## Why this exists

Because every time you want to start a new FastAPI project, you waste an hour repeating the same boring setup:  
creating the venv, installing dependencies, wiring the DB, configuring Alembic, copying `.env` samples, etc.

This repo gives you a clean, up-to-date, async-ready structure that you can clone and start coding immediately.  
No hacks, no tutorial boilerplate, no half-baked “example_app.py”s. Just a good foundation.
